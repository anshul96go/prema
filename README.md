# Prema Prediction Market

A prediction market web app.
So far only provides binary futures.

Uses [Mozilla Persona](http://127.0.0.1:8080) for authentification.

## Setup

SQLite is included, so you only need a D compiler
and the dub packaging tool.

1. Compile and run prema via `dub`.
2. Browse to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

## Desirable Features

* Multi-outcome markets
* Conditional and combinatorial markets
* Multiple languages (e.g. german)
* Limit and stop orders
* Shibboleth authentication
* REST API
* Real-time UI via Javascript magic
